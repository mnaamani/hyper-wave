# HyperWave — Architecture

HyperWave is a peer-to-peer "global stadium wave": peers join a match swarm, a ⚽
sweeps around a ring of participants (each peer fires its own moment on a shared,
deterministic schedule), each participant takes a selfie into a
shared gallery, their supported-country flag rides along — and real (testnet) money
flows through it: participation fees are **burned** on-chain (anti-spam, no beneficiary),
and viewers **tip** selfies directly. No sponsor rewards. No servers — discovery,
state, and storage are all peer-to-peer (Hyperswarm + Corestore/Hypercore), and payments are
self-custodial (WDK, Tron Nile testnet).

This document covers the **process/layer structure**. For the wire protocol and state
machine (enough to build a compatible client), see [`protocol.md`](./protocol.md).

The repo is an **npm-workspaces monorepo**: the reusable Bare engine lives in
`packages/hyperwave-engine/` and boots unchanged under two hosts — the desktop Electron
app (`apps/desktop/`) and an Expo + react-native-bare-kit mobile app (`apps/mobile/`). Each
host is a ~20–40-line shim over the engine's host-agnostic entry, `lib/engine.js` `createEngine()`.

**Why three processes?** It's the [`hello-pear-electron`](https://github.com/holepunchto/hello-pear-electron)
model: Chromium can't run the Holepunch P2P stack, so the networking lives in a **Bare**
worker (Holepunch's JS runtime), and the Electron **main** process brokers between the
sandboxed renderer and the worker.

The three-process split is **desktop-specific**. The engine itself is host-abstracted: on
mobile the same `hyperwave` boots as a single Bare **worklet**
(`packages/hyperwave-engine/worklet/app.js` under react-native-bare-kit, bundled by
`bare-pack`), driven by the React Native UI over the identical JSON IPC surface
(`apps/mobile/src/useEngine.js`) — no Electron main, no separate updater.

(Module format is a deliberate mix — see [Module format](#module-format).)

## The one seam: worker ⇄ renderer

Everything crosses a single boundary — the IPC bridge. The worker emits **events**; the
renderer sends **commands**. The renderer never touches the network or keys.

```
renderer  ──(commands)──▶  worker
  { type: 'start-wave' }                              // burn kick-off fee → announce + lobby
  { type: 'join-wave' }                               // verify wave paid → opt in + burn join fee
  { type: 'set-country', country }
  { type: 'stage-selfie', selfie: { image, caption } }  // lobby-captured; posts at my sweep slot
  { type: 'tip', to, amount }                         // real TRX to a selfie owner
  { type: 'send-trx', to, amount }                    // plain transfer to any address (wallet Send form)
  { type: 'refresh-wallet' }                          // manual balance re-check (after funding)
  { type: 'fetch-transactions' }                      // pull the on-chain tx history (wallet view)

worker  ──(events)──▶  renderer
  { type: 'state',   me, peers[], connected, discovered }  // ring membership (every change)
  { type: 'event',   event, ... }                     // lifecycle + race events (protocol.md)
  { type: 'gallery', items[] }                        // ordered selfies (every change)
  { type: 'wallet',  address, trx }                   // wallet chip (on ready + every 15s; { error } on init failure)
  { type: 'burn-result' | 'tip-result' | 'send-result', ... }  // fee/tip/send outcomes (toasts)
  { type: 'transactions', list[] }                    // on-chain history, both directions, newest first
```

Transport (desktop): `hyperwave.js` wraps `Bare.IPC` in a `FramedStream` and JSON-encodes
each message; `electron/main.js` relays the frames to/from the renderer, which uses the
preload `bridge` (`onWorkerIPC` / `writeWorkerIPC`). See `electron/preload.js`.

Transport (mobile): the worklet wraps `BareKit.IPC` in the **same** `FramedStream` + JSON
framing (`worklet/app.js`), driven from `apps/mobile/src/useEngine.js` over `Worklet.IPC` —
one message surface, two hosts. (The worklet additionally emits `engine-error` on an
unhandled rejection, since mobile has no console.)

## Design principle: where does logic live?

- **Protocol & authoritative state → worker.** Anything that defines correctness on the
  wire (discovery, the ring, the sweep schedule, lobby/roster, the attestations, the
  gallery + its write-gate) lives in the worker. Guards are _enforced_ here: e.g. "one
  wave at a time" is enforced by `wave.js`, not by hiding a button.
- **Presentation, user input, device APIs → renderer.** Canvas drawing, countdown
  animations, the webcam (`getUserMedia` — Chromium only), the gallery slideshow, and
  the flag rendering (`flagOf`) live in the renderer. The renderer holds only _derived_
  UI state (e.g. `waveActive` to hide a button); the worker remains the source of truth.
- **Borderline, intentionally renderer-side:** country **persistence** (`localStorage`)
  and the proof-window **capture timing** are user/UI preferences; the worker only stores
  the country _code_ and doesn't care when a selfie is taken (selfies are optional).

The worker computes ring **angles** (from peer public keys) and
sends them in `state`; the renderer consumes them for drawing and never recomputes them —
so there's no duplicated protocol logic across the seam.

> **Behind the seam:** the topology's only job is a **connected flood graph** —
> Hyperswarm's own topic mesh carries it (nothing is pinned). The wave itself is the
> sweep (`lib/sweep.js`): every peer derives its slot from the flooded roster.

## No roles — every peer is equal

There are no peer roles: every instance runs the same code and behaves identically. Every peer
participates fully (pays fees, joins waves, selfies, relays), and every peer's
`storageDir/hyperwave` store is **wiped on startup**, so galleries are ephemeral per run —
keyed by the random `waveId`, nothing persists across runs.

The gallery is a **multicore CRDT** — one Hypercore per participant, merged locally (no
indexer, no coordinator; see `protocol.md` §8) — so every participant already holds every
core and could serve the whole gallery. There is not even a per-wave asymmetry: the initiator
is an ordinary participant (posts its own selfie, publishes its own core, no indexer/admission
/retention role). A departing peer's selfie survives in everyone's view because they already
replicated it; the gallery is ephemeral once a new wave supersedes it, so nobody keeps cores
open across waves.

## Module format

- **Bare workers are CJS** (`require`/`module.exports`) — idiomatic for Bare and the
  template, and the worker entry is loaded by `PearRuntime.run`.
- **The renderer is ESM** (`import`/`export`) — it works over `file://` in the Electron
  renderer.

Bare _can_ run ESM (`.mjs`), but the workers are kept CJS: converting is all-or-nothing
across the require/import graph (`require()` of an ESM module throws), and the ESM
worker-entry boot under `pear-runtime` is unverified. The mix (Bare=CJS, browser=ESM) is
intentional and conventional. On mobile the React Native side (`App.js`, `useEngine.js`)
is ESM, while the worklet entry itself stays CJS (the `bare-pack` bundle output is
`.mjs`).
