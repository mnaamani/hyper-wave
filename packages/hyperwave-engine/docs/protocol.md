# HyperWave — Protocol & State Machine

A specification of the **on-wire protocol** and the per-peer **state machine**, detailed
enough to implement a compatible client in another language/framework. Everything here is
what peers exchange over the network; the Electron/renderer split (see
[`architecture.md`](../../../apps/docs/hosting.md)) is one implementation and is **not** part of the
protocol.

Reference implementation:
`packages/hyperwave-engine/lib/{wave,ring,sweep,attest,feed,feed-crdt}.js`.

> **The protocol is theme-agnostic.** It carries generic concepts — a **wave** that
> **sweeps** a **ring**, an **entry** whose `payload` is **opaque** to the protocol, in a
> per-wave **feed**, plus a cosmetic per-peer **tag**. The "stadium wave" is the reference
> _application_ (`apps/desktop`), which fills the entry payload with a `{image, caption}`
> selfie and uses the tag as a country code. Any turn-taking / coordinated-snapshot app can
> speak this same protocol.

## 1. Concepts & roles

- A **topic** is a swarm identified by a `topicId` string. Everyone on the same topic is
  on one **ring**.
- A **peer**'s cryptographic identity (an Ed25519 key pair) determines its fixed **seat**
  on the ring (an angle derived from its public key). The key pair is derived from a seed
  persisted at `<storage>/swarm.seed`, so a peer keeps the **same seat and identity across
  restarts** (independent of the wallet seed for key isolation — a leaked wallet seed shouldn't
  also compromise the ring signing identity. Note this is not unlinkability: a fee burn already
  ties the wallet address to the `peerId` on-chain via its `hyperwave:<waveId>:<peerId>` memo).
- A **wave** is a single, one-at-a-time event with a random `waveId`. Its lifecycle is
  **idle → lobby → racing → idle**. An **originator** announces it; peers **opt in** during
  the lobby (the **roster**) — each `wave-join` **publishes that peer's own feed core**
  (its writer key, self-certified by a join attestation). Every peer ingests every join it
  sees, so there is no admission and no coordinator. At lobby close the originator floods
  `wave-start` carrying **every participant's core credential** (`writers` — the roster is
  derived from it) plus the sweep parameters (`t0`, `lapMs`); then the wave **sweeps**: every peer derives the
  identical angle-ordered schedule locally and self-triggers at its own slot. There is no
  passed token — the wave is choreography, not an object — and the wave ends
  **deterministically** on every peer at `t0 + lapMs + END_GRACE_MS`, with no end message.
- Each roster member may post an **entry** to the wave's **feed** (a multicore CRDT — one
  Hypercore per participant, merged locally into one ordered view), gated by its signed **join
  attestation**.

There is no server and no coordinator beyond the per-wave originator. All peers run the
same logic.

## 2. Cryptographic primitives

| Primitive                              | Algorithm                     | Encoding on the wire      |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Key pair                               | Ed25519                       | —                         |
| Peer id (`peerId`, `id`, `by`)         | Ed25519 public key (32 bytes) | lowercase hex (64 chars)  |
| Hash (`crypto.hash`)                   | BLAKE2b-256 (32 bytes)        | lowercase hex (64 chars)  |
| Signature (`joinSig`, `sig`)           | Ed25519 sign/verify           | lowercase hex (128 chars) |
| `waveId`                               | 16 random bytes               | lowercase hex (32 chars)  |
| `timestamp`, `hopCount`, `t0`, `lapMs` | integers                      | JSON numbers (base-10)    |

Hex is lowercase throughout. Byte concatenation is raw bytes (not hex strings).

### 2.1 Ring angle (seat)

Given a 32-byte public key `K`:

```
n     = K[0]*256^5 + K[1]*256^4 + K[2]*256^3 + K[3]*256^2 + K[4]*256 + K[5]   // top 6 bytes, big-endian
angle = (n / 2^48) * 360      // degrees in [0, 360)
```

Angle is **always derived locally** from a peer's id; it is never trusted from the wire.

> Why is the angle derived this way? It's a deterministic, uniform hash-to-circle: take enough high-order key bits to make collisions negligible, but few enough (48) to stay within JavaScripts's exact-integer range (53 bits), normalize to [0,1), scale to degrees. Uniform placement, no coordination, no trust, and cheap pure-integer math.

> One nuance worth noting: it uses only the top 6 of 32 bytes for the angle, but identity/ordering still uses the full key elsewhere — so the truncation is purely about the visual/ring geometry, not about security.

### 2.2 Join attestation

A peer's signed opt-in to a wave, binding its ring identity to the feed **core** it owns
and publishes:

```
joinHash(waveId, peerId, writerKey)
    = BLAKE2b-256( utf8( "join|" + waveId + "|" + peerId + "|" + writerKey ) )

joinSig = hex( Ed25519_sign( joinHash, mySecretKey ) )
verify  = Ed25519_verify( joinHash, fromHex(joinSig), fromHex(peerId) )
```

It rides `wave-join` (which **publishes** the participant's feed core; §8.2) and every
feed entry (the write-gate in `mergeFeed()`, §8.2). Covering `writerKey` matters: it is
what makes each core key **self-certifying** — without it, a relay could substitute its own
core key under someone else's `peerId` and hijack that peer's one feed seat. There is no
shared feed key to sign; this attestation is the only credential the feed needs. This is
authenticity, not uniqueness — one-entry-per-peer and the byte caps bound what a seat can do.

### 2.3 Fee-burn attestation

The signed proof binding a peer's ring identity to its on-chain fee burn (schema and
verification in §9.0):

```
burnHash(waveId, peerId, reason, amount, txHash, tronAddress, burnTs)
    = BLAKE2b-256( utf8( waveId + "|" + peerId + "|" + reason + "|" + amount + "|"
                         + txHash + "|" + tronAddress + "|" + burnTs ) )

sig = hex( Ed25519_sign( burnHash, mySecretKey ) )
```

## 3. Transport

- **Topic:** `topic = BLAKE2b-256( utf8(topicId) )` (32 bytes). Join the Hyperswarm DHT
  with `join(topic, { server: true, client: true })`. Default `topicId` in the reference
  build is `"hyperwave:demo:v1"`.
- **Per connection** (Noise-encrypted duplex stream from Hyperswarm):
  1. `Corestore.replicate(conn)` — replicates the per-participant feed cores (see §8).
  2. A **Protomux** channel with protocol id `"hyperwave/gossip"`, carrying a single
     message type whose encoding is `compact-encoding` **`string`** (length-prefixed
     UTF-8). Each message is a **JSON object** with a `kind` field.
- **Broadcast** = send a message on every open gossip channel. **Direct** = send only on
  a specific peer's channel (used for `wave-sync` to a newcomer).
- The gossip channel and the Corestore replication share the same underlying stream
  (Protomux multiplexes them).

**Wire encoding — JSON, and when to revisit.** Gossip messages are JSON (a baked-in design
rule). This is deliberate and, today, correct: the six kinds are tiny and infrequent (hex ids,
one signature, a few integers — the only large payload, the selfie, rides a Hypercore block, not
gossip), so a binary encoding would save almost nothing on the wire; JSON stays trivially
loggable for debugging a flooded mesh; and signature safety is **independent of the wire** —
attestations sign a canonical `|`-delimited tuple hash (`attest.js`), never the JSON envelope, so
JSON's non-canonicity (key order/whitespace) never touches verification. The one benefit a
versioned binary encoding (e.g. `hyperschema`/`compact-encoding`) would add that JSON lacks is
**append-only cross-version wire compatibility** — but that only pays off once there is real
version skew on a shared topic: **independent client implementations, or rolling upgrades across a
long-lived (non-per-match) topic**. That is the trigger to revisit. Until then the codegen build
step, the loss of loggability, and reopening the one-encoding rule outweigh it. Even when
revisited, only the message **envelope** would change encoding; the signed attestation tuple in
`attest.js` stays its own canonical format regardless. (The internal app IPC made the opposite
call for the opposite reason — it adopted `bare-rpc` but kept JSON, because a single-build IPC has
no version skew for a schema to solve; see Appendix A.)

All timing constants are in §10.

### 3.1 Message propagation & relay rules

Past Hyperswarm's mesh limit a large swarm is only a **partial random mesh** — each peer
is directly connected to ~its connection-limit's worth of a random subset, so a plain
one-hop broadcast reaches only a fraction of the swarm. Different message classes are
propagated differently to match what each needs:

| Class                       | Messages                                   | Fanout                                     |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Flood (relayed + dedup)** | `wave-announce`, `wave-join`, `wave-start` | every peer                                 |
| **One-hop broadcast**       | `heartbeat`                                | every direct connection (no relay)         |
| **Unicast**                 | `wave-sync`                                | one specific peer (a newcomer, on connect) |

**Flood (epidemic broadcast).** The wave _lifecycle_ messages must reach every seat, so they
are relayed hop-to-hop:

- The originator stamps the message with a unique `mid` (random message id) and broadcasts it to all
  direct connections.
- On **first** receipt of a given `mid`, a peer records it, **re-broadcasts** to its other
  neighbours (everyone except the sender), and then processes it locally. On any **repeat**
  `mid` it does nothing (drops the duplicate) — this dedup (de-duplication) is what stops loops and bounds the
  flood.
- On the partial random mesh (average degree ≈ connection limit, diameter ≈ log N / log
  degree ≈ a few hops) this blankets the whole swarm in ~2–3 relay rounds — hundreds of ms,
  far inside the lobby — and is robust to peer/link loss thanks to the many redundant paths.
- Cost is O(edges) message-sends per flood; fine for the handful of small, infrequent
  lifecycle messages. Seen-`mid`s are capped (`GOSSIP_SEEN_CAP`); at the cap the **oldest** id
  is evicted first, so under pressure the dedup set forgets the ids least likely to still be
  in flight rather than the recent ones.

**Unicast.** **`wave-sync`** is sent point-to-point to a newcomer on connect (§7.4) — the
catch-up path for a peer that joins after a flood has already passed.

**Membership** is **DHT-discovered but liveness-gated.** `swarm.peers` (Hyperswarm's PeerInfo
set on the topic) drives the host's start gating (the `discovered` count), not the visible
ring — a DHT announcement alone is just "this key advertised the topic once", so a stale
announce from a since-closed instance is never shown as a seat. A **seat requires real
liveness**: a live connection or direct gossip. The only membership gossip is the
**`heartbeat`** (a peer's own `id` + `tag`, sent one hop to every direct connection
every `HEARTBEAT_MS`): it refreshes `lastSeen` and carries the cosmetic tag — nothing
else. There is **no pointer exchange**: peers do not gossip ring structure — the sweep
needs no successor precision.

**The topology is Hyperswarm's own topic mesh — nothing is pinned.** Peers dial whoever
the DHT surfaces for the topic (up to `maxPeers`), and the flood rides those incidental
connections. The sweep needs only a **connected flood graph** with small diameter, and a
random mesh of degree ≈ `maxPeers` has one with overwhelming probability (validated at
128 peers over a local DHT: the incidental mesh alone gathered the full lobby). The
accepted trade-off: flood connectivity depends entirely on the transport's mesh quality.
**`wave-sync`** is the catch-up path for a peer that connects (or subscribes) after a
flood has passed.

**Directory vs subscribed scoping (scaling.md Phases 2–3).** The shared topic is a
**directory**: everyone on it exchanges `heartbeat` (liveness) + `wave-announce` (the
browse surface), and a peer connecting late gets a unicast **`catchup` re-announce** for
every wave the neighbour knows. A wave's **heavy control gossip (`wave-join`/`wave-start`/
`wave-sync`)** is scoped to its **subscribers**: each peer advertises its subscription set
in a one-hop **`subs`** message, and a wave's join/start is forwarded only to neighbours
whose set contains it — so a peer's control-plane traffic is **O(subscribed)**, not
O(topic). Subscribing also joins the wave's own sub-topic `hash("hyperwave:wave:" +
topicId + ":" + waveId)` so its participants discover each other off the O(N) directory
mesh. **Feed replication auto-scopes**: a peer opens (hence replicates) a wave's cores only
while subscribed. All of this rides **one Protomux channel per connection** — the scoping
is a send-side filter, not separate channels (per-wave sub-channels were tried but their
dynamic-open pairing races the first flood; the `subs` filter self-heals via a sync on
mutual subscription).

## 4. Peer map (membership & liveness)

Each peer maintains a map of **other** peers (never itself), keyed by id:
`id -> { id, angle, lastSeen, tag }`. `angle` is derived from `id` (§2.1) — never
trusted from the wire; `tag` is a cosmetic short string (or null — the reference app uses an ISO-3166-1 alpha-2 country code).

Inputs that build the map:

| Event                                                                            | Effect                                                                                                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DHT discovery** (`swarm.peers`, refreshed on `swarm.on('update')` + each tick) | `upsert(id, now)` for every discovered PeerInfo — the primary membership source.                                     |
| connection **open**                                                              | `upsert(remoteId, now)`; lift any churn cooldown. A direct connection is authoritative liveness.                     |
| connection **close**                                                             | delete the peer; set a churn cooldown (`PEER_STALE_MS`) so DHT re-seeding can't immediately resurrect the dead peer. |
| `heartbeat { id, tag }`                                                          | `upsert(id, now, tag)` — refresh the sender's seat + tag.                                                            |

```
upsert(id, lastSeen, tag):
  if id == me: return
  cur = map[id]
  if cur is missing OR lastSeen > cur.lastSeen:
      map[id] = { id, angle: angleOf(id), lastSeen, tag: tag ?? cur?.tag ?? null }
  else if tag is set:
      cur.tag = tag          # tag always tracks the latest report
```

So `lastSeen` is **monotonic per peer** (only advances) and `angle` is always recomputed
from the id.

**Liveness and the ring.** A peer is **live** if `now − lastSeen < PEER_STALE_MS`. The
**ring** is the live peers sorted by angle. A direct disconnect removes a peer
immediately; the TTL expires peers known _indirectly_ (a `swarm.peers` entry that has
since gone) once they stop being refreshed.

Note the peer map serves **topology and display**, not the sweep: the sweep's schedule is
derived from the flooded `wave-start`'s `by`/`writers` (§6), so all peers agree on it even
if their live-ring views differ.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Dht["swarm.peers (DHT discovery)"] --> U0["upsert id, now"]
  Conn["connection open"] --> U["upsert id, now"]
  Ptr["heartbeat (id, tag)"] --> U3["upsert sender now, tag"]
  U0 --> M[("peer map")]
  U --> M
  U3 --> M
  Close["connection close"] -->|delete| M
  M --> L["live = now minus lastSeen &lt; TTL, sorted by angle"]
```

On connect, a peer **greets** the newcomer with its `heartbeat` and — if a wave is active —
a `wave-sync` (§7.4), so the newcomer's map _and_ wave state converge immediately.

## 5. Gossip message catalog

The protocol has **six** message kinds, all JSON objects on the one `hyperwave/gossip`
channel per connection. Unknown `kind`s are ignored. `wave-announce` floods the whole
directory; `wave-join`/`wave-start` flood only a wave's subscribers (§3, scaling.md
Phase 3); `heartbeat`/`subs`/`wave-sync` are one-hop.

### 5.0 Uniform message envelope

> **Status: implemented.** Every gossip message carries a uniform envelope on top of its `kind`
> and payload. This replaced the old inconsistent per-kind author field (`id`/`by`/`peerId`) and
> the partially-signed wire.

```jsonc
{
  "kind": "<message-kind>",
  "origin": "<peerId>", // who authored the message (one convention everywhere)
  "ts": 1719705612080, // origin timestamp (ms) — when the author created the message
  "sig": "<hex128>", // Ed25519 signature by origin's ring key over the canonical
  // serialization of the whole message minus `sig` (attest.signMessage)
  "mid": "<hex16>" // flooded kinds only — the dedup id (covered by `sig`)
  // …kind-specific payload fields…
}
```

- **`origin`** — the single authorship field on every message (peerId = the ring public key in
  hex). `angle` is derived from it locally (§2.1), never trusted from the wire. There is **no**
  separate `id`/`by`/`peerId` author field — `origin` is the author everywhere. The one exception
  is `wave-sync`'s **`by`**, which is the wave INITIATOR (payload) distinct from `origin` (the peer
  that _sent_ the sync). Identity binding (§11.2) is now **one shared check**: a DIRECT
  (one-hop: heartbeat/subs/wave-sync) message's `origin` must equal the Noise connection id; a
  FLOODED message's `origin` is a third party at relay hops, authenticated by `sig`.
- **`sig`** — an Ed25519 signature by `origin`'s ring key over the canonical serialization
  (recursively key-sorted JSON, `attest.stableStringify`) of the message with `sig` removed. Any
  relay or recipient verifies authenticity (`attest.verifyMessage`) **before acting or
  re-flooding**, so a forgery can't be amplified and authenticity no longer depends on the
  connection a flooded message arrived over. This **generalizes** the domain signatures (the join
  `joinSig`, the burn `sig`) rather than replacing them: those still bind their own tuples; the
  envelope `sig` authenticates the whole message. (The signing choke point is wave.js's
  `originate()` — every ORIGINATED message is sealed there; relays forward the sealed frame
  verbatim, so `origin`/`sig` stay the originator's across every hop.)
- **`ts`** — the origin timestamp. The receive edge **drops (and never relays) any message whose
  `ts` is older than `GOSSIP_MAX_AGE_MS` (5 min)** or implausibly in the future (`CLOCK_SKEW_MS`,
  1 min). This is a **hard cap on how long a flooded message can circulate** — independent of `mid`
  dedup — so a routing loop / dedup-set bug can't amplify into unbounded flooding; and it is
  **replay-attack prevention**: a captured message can't be re-injected later because its `ts` is
  signed and can't be refreshed without the author's key (§11.2). Generous clock-skew tolerance
  (peers aren't time-synchronized). The kick-off burn additionally carries a signed `burnTs` with
  its own freshness window (§9.0) — belt-and-suspenders against reusing an old burn in a fresh frame.

**Shape enforcement.** The schemas below are code, not just documentation: `lib/messages.js`
defines one factory per kind (every send site builds the KIND + PAYLOAD through it) and one shape
validator per kind. `validGossip` runs once at the receive edge — it checks the envelope
(`origin`/`ts`/`sig` well-typed, + `mid` on flooded kinds) and the payload — before the signature
verification, age check, and state work. An unknown kind, a missing envelope/field, or a mistyped
field drops the message; unknown extra fields are tolerated (forward compatibility). Validation is
shape only — the `sig` verification, age check, paid gate, and hostile-value clamps are in the
handlers (wave.js) / attest.js.

> Each schema below shows the **kind + payload**. Every message ALSO carries the §5.0 envelope
> (`origin`, `ts`, `sig`, + `mid` on flooded kinds); it is omitted from the blocks for brevity.
> The author is always `origin` — there is no per-kind `id`/`by`/`peerId` (except `wave-sync`'s
> `by`, the wave initiator).

### heartbeat — one hop to every connection, every `HEARTBEAT_MS`

```json
{
  "kind": "heartbeat",
  "tag": "BR" | null
}
```

Pure liveness + cosmetic tag, sent one hop to every direct connection (not relayed). The sender
is the envelope `origin` (which, being a direct message, must equal the Noise connection id).
Receiver upserts the sender (`lastSeen = now`, `tag`). It carries **no ring
structure** — the sweep needs no successor precision. Every peer is equal
— the heartbeat carries no role and no peer is special. Primary membership comes from DHT
discovery (`swarm.peers`); the heartbeat is liveness, not the authoritative peer set.

### subs — my subscription set, one hop (on connect + on change)

```json
{
  "kind": "subs",
  "subs": ["<waveId>", "..."]
}
```

The waves this peer is subscribed to (holds cores for). Sent on connect and whenever it
subscribes/unsubscribes (scaling.md Phases 2–3). A neighbour records it and forwards a
wave's `wave-join`/`wave-start` here **only if** the set contains that wave — the send-side
scoping that makes control traffic O(subscribed). On learning a **newly-mutual**
subscription, the peer unicasts a `wave-sync` to catch the neighbour up (so a late
subscribe or a flood that raced the subscription is always recovered). Not relayed; carries
no `mid`.

The three `wave-*` lifecycle messages below are **flooded** (§3.1): each carries a unique
`mid` (random hex id); receivers relay on first sight and drop repeats.

### wave-announce — flooded (originator, on start)

```json
{
  "kind": "wave-announce",
  "waveId": "<hex16>",
  "lobbyMs": 15000,
  "paid": {
    /* start attestation, §9.0 — present when the paid-wave gate is enforced */
  },
  "walletType": "tron-nile" // the payment-mechanism id (paid waves) — see below
}
```

Opens the lobby; the envelope `origin` is the initiator. Receivers that accept it (§7.1 adoption)
enter `lobby` for `waveId` (as merely **aware** — no cores open until they subscribe/join, §7.2).
A fresh announce floods the whole directory. On connect, a peer also **forwards the initiator's
stored, signed announce VERBATIM** (same frame, same `mid`, same `origin`/`sig`) for every wave it
knows, so a peer that joined the swarm after the original flood can still discover the wave — the
receiver re-verifies the initiator's envelope sig, and if it relays the frame on, the original
`mid` dedups it within one hop (no amplification, no separate catch-up message kind).

**No shared feed key.** There is no shared per-wave feed core and no feed key to
carry or sign — each participant owns its own feed core (§8). The originator is a participant too: right
after announcing it floods **its own** `wave-join` publishing its core (`floodMyFeedCore`),
exactly as every joiner does.

**Paid-wave gate (anti-spam).** When enforced (every instance has a wallet), the initiator
**does not announce until it has burned the start fee and confirmed it on-chain** — the
announce then carries `paid`, the start `burn-proof`. A peer **ignores any announce whose
`paid` proof is missing or not validly signed** (an unpaid/spam wave is invisible), and before
it will **join** (and pay its own fee) it verifies the burn **on-chain** (`verifyBurnTx`:
`to == ` the black hole, `amount ≥ fee`, memo commits `waveId`). `join()` is refused until the
start is `verified`. So no peer ever pays into a wave the initiator hasn't paid for. The
same `paid` proof rides `wave-sync`, so a mid-lobby newcomer can verify too. (Without wallets
— headless/tests — enforcement is off and waves announce immediately, unpaid.)

**Payment-mechanism type (`walletType`).** The engine talks to payments through an abstract
`Wallet` interface (a base class in `wallet.js`), so an app can plug in its own wallet — a
different chain, a custodial service, a mock. Each wallet declares a `type` id (the default Tron
wallet is `"tron-nile"`). A **paid** wave carries its initiator's `walletType` on `wave-announce`
(and `wave-start`/`wave-sync`), authenticated by the envelope `sig` (§5.0). A joiner can only pay
with a wallet of the SAME type — verifying the burn + paying the fee are wallet-specific — so
`join()` **refuses** a wave whose `walletType` its own wallet doesn't match (or when it has no
wallet), emitting `join-blocked` with `reason: "wallet-unsupported"`. Such a peer can still
subscribe/spectate (free). A wave with **no** `walletType` (an unpaid / wallet-less initiator)
imposes no payment mechanism, so any peer may join — the wallet-less default. This lets peers with
incompatible payment mechanisms coexist on a topic: each joins only the waves it can actually pay.

### wave-join — flooded (a peer opting in during lobby)

```json
{
  "kind": "wave-join",
  "waveId": "<hex16>",
  "writerKey": "<coreKeyHex>",
  "joinSig": "<hex64>",
  "burn": {
    /* the joiner's fee-burn attestation, §9.0 — once its join fee confirms */
  }
}
```

**The join publishes the peer's feed core.** The joiner is the envelope `origin`. `writerKey` is
its own Hypercore key for this wave's feed (§8), and `joinSig` is its join attestation over
`(waveId, origin, writerKey)` (§2.2). **Every peer** that sees the join (during the lobby)
verifies `joinSig`, adds `origin` to the `writers` map, and opens+downloads that core (block 0
only, §8.2) — there is no admission and no coordinator. A joiner whose join fee confirms mid-lobby
**re-floods** its `wave-join` with the `burn` attestation attached (paid gate). A join without a
credential is ignored — the `writers` map is the roster, so a seat that can never post would only
stretch the schedule with a guaranteed-empty slot.

Flooded (to the wave's subscribers, §3) so it reaches every subscriber (and the initiator, which
assembles the roster) even across a partial mesh. `wave-join` is authenticated by the envelope
`sig` (and its `joinSig` binds the credential) — it is relayed, so at relay hops its `origin` is a
third party. **Paid gate:** when enforced, **every peer** ignores a `wave-join` whose `burn`
doesn't authorize `origin` for `waveId` (`burnAuthorizes`, §9.2) before ingesting it — the check
that was once the initiator's alone at admission.

### wave-start — flooded (originator, when the lobby closes)

```json
{
  "kind": "wave-start",
  "waveId": "<hex16>",
  "writers": [{ "peerId": "<peerId>", "writerKey": "<coreKeyHex>", "joinSig": "<hex64>" }, ...],
  "t0": 1719705612080,
  "lapMs": 8000,
  "paid": { /* start attestation, §9.0 — present when the paid-wave gate is enforced */ }
}
```

Finalizes the roster and starts the sweep; the envelope `origin` is the initiator. The
**canonical roster is derived, not carried**: `{origin} ∪ writers[].peerId` — the initiator plus
every credentialed joiner (no separate roster field travels; `writers` is the single membership
source). (`writers[].peerId` are the participants — DATA — distinct from the message `origin`.)
`t0` is the epoch-ms moment the sweep begins
(`now + SWEEP_LEAD_MS` at the initiator — a short lead so the flooded start blankets the
swarm before the first slot fires); `lapMs` is the lap duration,
`clamp(rosterSize × SLOT_MS, MIN_LAP_MS, MAX_LAP_MS)`. Every receiver derives the identical
schedule from `(origin + writers, t0, lapMs)` (§6). Receivers clamp hostile values: `lapMs` is capped
at `MAX_LAP_MS`, and a start whose `t0` is more than `MAX_LAP_MS` in the future is ignored
(§11.2).

**`writers` makes the start self-contained.** It carries every participant's feed-core
credential (`{peerId, writerKey, joinSig}` — the same tuple `wave-join` published), so a peer
that adopts via `wave-start` **without having seen the lobby's `wave-join`s** still learns
every core and can render the full feed. Each entry is re-verified (`verifyJoin`) before
its core is opened. The `burn` is **omitted** here (the writers were pre-vetted by the
initiator during the lobby; the wave itself is gated by the start `paid` proof). This
grows `wave-start` to O(N) in the roster — an extension of the existing O(N)-roster scale
concern (the broader path to thousands of peers is the **concurrent-waves sharding model** in the
[scaling design note](./scaling.md), which bounds each wave's roster rather than growing one).
If ever compressed at large N, it must preserve **both** self-containment and
determinism: lossless framing (deflate the frame — see §3) does, and roughly halves the
hex+JSON writers array (~256 B/entry → ~130 B, the crypto-entropy floor of
peerId+writerKey+joinSig). A lossy scheme that ships only peerId **prefixes** and resolves
`writerKey`/`joinSig` from each peer's locally-cached `wave-join`s does **not**: it reinstates
the non-self-containment `writers` exists to remove (a peer that missed a join can't resolve
its prefix), and prefix resolution against per-peer-divergent id sets is ambiguous and
grindable (peerIds gate feed writes + tips). Deriving the roster from received `wave-join`s
instead of carrying `writers` fails for the same determinism reason as below. When the paid-wave gate is enforced, `wave-start` also carries the start `paid`
proof and is gated on it (§11); carrying it also lets a peer that adopted via `wave-start`
re-authenticate a later `wave-sync` to a newcomer. Receivers transition `lobby → racing`.

The derived roster is the initiator-finalized answer to "who is actually in this wave?" —
flooded (inside `writers`) so (a) everyone agrees on membership despite the lobby's flooded,
partial-mesh joins (it is the **canonical input to the schedule**: all peers must compute the
same slots), and (b) each peer knows whether it has a slot (roster member) or merely watches
(spectator).

### wave-sync — DIRECT to a newly-connected peer (join-time state)

```json
{
  "kind": "wave-sync",
  "waveId": "<hex16>",
  "phase": "lobby" | "racing",
  "by": "<peerId>",
  "writers": [{ "peerId": "<peerId>", "writerKey": "<coreKeyHex>", "joinSig": "<hex64>" }, ...],
  "t0": 1719705612080,
  "lapMs": 8000,
  "lobbyMsLeft": 8000
}
```

Lets a peer joining mid-wave sync (§7.4). **This is the one kind where `origin` ≠ the subject:**
the envelope `origin` (which, being direct, must equal the Noise connection id) is the peer that
_sent_ the sync — any subscriber — while **`by` is the wave INITIATOR** (the roster derives from
`{by} ∪ writers[].peerId`, and `by` signed the `paid` proof). Like `wave-start`, it carries the
`writers` array —
every participant's feed-core credential — so a newcomer (in either phase) learns every
core without needing to have seen the lobby's `wave-join`s; each is re-verified (`verifyJoin`)
before its core is opened. `t0`/`lapMs` (racing phase) let a mid-race newcomer derive the
schedule, animate the ball from the right point, and end at the same deterministic moment as
everyone else. When the paid-wave gate is enforced, a `wave-sync` must carry the start
`paid` proof (§9.0) **for either phase** — including `racing` — and is adopted only if it
verifies (§11), so a fabricated racing sync can't push a newcomer into a bogus wave. (`paid`
is omitted from the schema line above for brevity.)

## 6. The sweep

The wave's propagation is a **deterministic angular sweep** — pure local computation from
the flooded `wave-start`, no per-hop messages, no passed object.

### 6.1 Schedule derivation

Every peer computes the identical schedule from the canonical inputs — the derived roster
(`{by} ∪ writers[].peerId`) plus `(t0, lapMs)`:

```
seats  = dedupe(rosterIds), each with angle = angleOf(id)            // §2.1
sort seats by (angle asc, id asc)                                    // id breaks angle ties
count  = |seats|
slot[rank] = { id, angle, rank, at: t0 + round((rank / count) × lapMs) }
```

`rank` (0-based, angle order) is the entry's **`hopCount`** — still the feed ordering key
(§8.3). Because the inputs are the flooded `by`/`writers` and two integers, all honest
peers derive byte-identical schedules; nothing about the sweep depends on any peer's local
ring view.

### 6.2 Slot firing (my moment)

A roster member arms a local timer for its own slot. When it fires:

- Record the slot (`waveId`, `hopCount = rank`) into the entry pipeline. The pipeline pairs
  it with the entry **staged during the lobby** and posts the feed entry (§8.2) —
  whichever half arrives second triggers the post, exactly once per wave.
- Emit the local `holding` event (UI: "the wave is at my seat").

Posting is immediate — the peer **owns** its feed core (§8.2), so there is no admission
and nothing to wait for; it appends its one entry at block 0. The wave itself never waits on
anything either.

**The entry is captured up-front, in the lobby.** The sweep must never wait on a human, so
capture and posting are split: when a peer opts in, the renderer opens the camera and shows a
countdown; the captured frame is **staged** to the worker (`stage-entry`), and posted at the
peer's slot. Everyone captures around the same moment, at a relaxed pace — independent of
ring size.

### 6.3 Ball animation (position events)

Every peer — roster member or spectator — walks the schedule locally and emits a `position`
event as each slot's time passes (`{ holder, angle, hopCount }`). The ⚽ on every screen is
rendered from this local walk; **there is no position gossip**. A mid-race newcomer that
adopts via `wave-sync` flushes the already-past slots at once and animates from the current
point.

### 6.4 Deterministic end

Every peer ends the wave at `t0 + lapMs + END_GRACE_MS` on its **own local timer**, emitting
`completed { waveId, hops: scheduleLength, angle: originatorAngle }`. There is no end
message: completion needs no trust and cannot be lost in the mesh, and every peer finishes
together (modulo clock skew).

### 6.5 Dead peers

A dead or unreachable roster member's slot **simply passes** — nobody waits, nothing stalls,
no healing is needed. The cost is one empty beat in the choreography (and one missing
feed entry); the wave's duration is fixed regardless.

### 6.6 Receiver-side clamps

A hostile or buggy `wave-start` (or racing `wave-sync`) can't wedge a wave open:

- `lapMs` is clamped to `MAX_LAP_MS` (and must be a positive finite number);
- a start whose `t0` is more than `MAX_LAP_MS` in the future is ignored;
- `t0`/`lapMs` must be finite numbers or the start is ignored.

So the longest any adopted wave can occupy a peer is bounded by
`MAX_LAP_MS (horizon) + MAX_LAP_MS (lap) + END_GRACE_MS`.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  WS["wave-start / wave-sync(racing)"] --> CL{"t0, lapMs finite?<br/>t0 − now ≤ MAX_LAP_MS?"}
  CL -- no --> D["ignore"]
  CL -- yes --> SCH["derive schedule from canonical roster<br/>(sort by angle, slot = t0 + rank/count × lapMs)"]
  SCH --> MY["arm MY slot (roster members):<br/>record slot → post staged entry"]
  SCH --> POS["walk schedule locally:<br/>position events (the ⚽ on every screen)"]
  SCH --> END["local timer at t0 + lapMs + grace:<br/>completed → idle (every peer)"]
```

## 7. Wave lifecycle state machine

Each peer holds at most one `wave = { id, phase, by, writers:Map, joined:bool }` (or
`null` = **idle**), plus `endedWaves:Set` (finished ids).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
  [*] --> idle
  idle --> lobby: kick off (idle only), or hear wave-announce / wave-sync(lobby)
  lobby --> racing: lobby timer (originator), or wave-start / wave-sync(racing)
  lobby --> idle: lobby timeout (start never arrived)
  racing --> idle: deterministic end timer (t0 + lapMs + grace)
```

A full wave, three peers (angle order O → B → C):

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  autonumber
  participant O as Originator
  participant B as Peer B
  participant C as Peer C
  Note over O,C: idle
  O-)B: wave-announce (paid)
  O-)C: wave-announce
  Note right of O: publishes its own feed core
  O-)B: wave-join (O: writerKey, joinSig)
  B-)O: wave-join (B: writerKey, joinSig)
  B-)C: wave-join
  Note over O,C: lobby — every peer ingests each join: opens that participant's core
  Note over O,C: roster O and B
  Note right of O: lobby timer fires
  O-)B: wave-start (writers, t0, lapMs)
  O-)C: wave-start
  Note over O,C: racing — every peer derives the same schedule
  Note over O: t = t0 — O's slot fires, posts staged entry
  Note over B: t = t0 + lapMs/2 — B's slot fires, posts staged entry
  Note over O,C: every screen animates the ⚽ locally (no messages)
  Note over O,C: t = t0 + lapMs + grace — every peer's end timer fires: completed → idle
```

(Open arrows = **flooded** gossip. C never joined, so it has no slot — it watches the same
sweep and ends at the same moment.)

### 7.1 Adoption (`canAdopt(waveId)`)

- If `waveId ∈ endedWaves` → **reject** (a finished wave never restarts).
- Otherwise → **accept**.

**Concurrent waves** (scaling.md Phase 1): the wave FSM is multiplexed — the engine holds a
`Map<waveId, WaveState>` and runs `lobby → racing → idle` **per wave**, so several waves can be
engaged at once on the one topic. The former singleton rule (one wave at a time) and its
lower-`waveId`-wins tie-break are **gone** — they existed only to collapse concurrent starts onto a
single wave (`shouldAdopt` → `canAdopt`). Nothing is superseded on a new start; each wave lives and
ends on its own timers. The gossip wire is unchanged (already keyed by `waveId`).

### 7.2 Awareness, subscription, and roles

Being **aware** of a wave (you accepted its `wave-announce`) is distinct from
**subscribing** to it (scaling.md Phase 2). An aware peer tracks the wave's existence
(roster count) for the browse list and relays its announce, but opens **no cores**.
`subscribe()` opens the wave's feed (my own core + the roster's) and joins its sub-topic;
`unsubscribe()` closes them. `join()` implies subscribe. `autoSubscribe` (default true)
subscribes on awareness — the single-wave demo UX; false gives browse-then-pick. This bounds
a peer's core budget to **O(subscribed)**, not O(all announced waves).

Among **subscribed** peers there are still no lasting roles:

- **Originator:** the peer that called `startWave` — sends `wave-announce`, publishes its own
  feed core (`floodMyFeedCore`), runs the lobby timer, and sends `wave-start` with
  `writers` and the sweep parameters. It is otherwise an **ordinary participant** with no
  lasting asymmetry: its slot is wherever its angle falls, it posts its own entry, and there
  is no indexer, admission, or retention role. (Every _subscriber_ holds every core during
  the wave — §8 — so a departing peer's entry survives; a subscribed wave's feed stays open
  until `unsubscribe()` or `close()` — the post-race idle gallery + latecomer replication rely
  on it; it is **not** auto-closed at wave-end, since final-slot entries keep replicating past
  the deterministic end.)
- **Joiner (roster):** subscribed **and** opted in during the lobby (`wave-join` publishes its
  feed core); gets an entry prompt and a slot in the schedule.
- **Spectator:** subscribed but not in the roster — holds the feed and animates the same sweep,
  ends at the same moment, but has no slot and never posts. **A peer whose join misses the
  lobby is a spectator**: the roster freezes into the schedule at lobby close, so a late join
  can't take a slot it could never fill.

### 7.3 Catch-up sync

Lifecycle floods fire once, so a peer connecting or subscribing mid-wave would miss them. Two
catch-up paths converge state: a **`catchup` re-announce** on connect (directory; makes a
newcomer _aware_, §5 wave-announce), and a **`wave-sync`** exchanged when two peers become
mutually subscribed (each learns the other's subscription from a `subs` message and unicasts
a sync). The subscriber receiving a `wave-sync`:

- `phase: lobby` → enter the lobby (join window with `lobbyMsLeft` remaining), ingest every
  credential in `writers` (open each participant's core) — then it can flood its own
  `wave-join` and join.
- `phase: racing` → ingest `writers` (open every participant's core), derive the schedule from
  `(by + writers, t0, lapMs)`, and go straight to `racing` as a spectator — animating from the
  current point and ending at the same deterministic moment.

Because the sync fires on **mutual subscription** (not merely on connect), a join or start
flood that raced the subscription is always recovered.

### 7.4 Ending & anti-revival

A wave ends on every peer's own deterministic end timer (`t0 + lapMs + END_GRACE_MS`), or —
if the start never arrives — a lobby-timeout fallback. On ending: add `waveId` to
`endedWaves`, return to idle. Because `endedWaves` blocks re-adoption, a straggler flood
can't revive a finished wave.

## 8. Feed (multicore CRDT)

Each wave has its own feed: a **conflict-free replicated data type** built from many
single-writer Hypercores — **one per participant** — merged locally into one ordered view.
There is **no indexer, no linearizer, and no shared "feed key"**: the same set
of cores produces a byte-identical feed on every peer, so convergence is purely epidemic
("have I replicated core X?"). (`feed-crdt.js` `CrdtFeed` + the pure `mergeFeed()` in
`feed.js`.)

### 8.1 Per-participant cores

- **Each participant owns one Hypercore** in the per-wave namespace `wave-feed:<waveId>` —
  a **named** (deterministic) core, so no key needs to be shared out-of-band. That core's key
  **is** the participant's `writerKey`. It starts empty per wave (the namespace is keyed by
  the random `waveId`).
- **The join publishes the key.** A participant floods its `writerKey` on its own `wave-join`
  (§5), self-certified by the join attestation `joinSig` over `(waveId, peerId, writerKey)`
  (§2.2). The originator is a participant too and floods its own `wave-join` right after
  announcing. There is no signed feed key because there is no shared core to sign — each
  core key stands on its own join attestation, so a relay can neither forge nor substitute one.
- Cores replicate over the existing `Corestore.replicate(conn)` on each connection. Entry
  payloads are **inline JSON** (the reference app's images are dataURLs), so these cores are the only set to
  propagate.
- `valueEncoding`: JSON. Each core holds **exactly one** op — the participant's `wave-entry`
  at block 0.

### 8.2 Ingest, merge, and the write-gate

There is no admission: a peer doesn't grant writers, it just **learns and replicates** them.

- **Every peer ingests every `wave-join` it sees** during the lobby (`CrdtFeed.addWriter`):
  it verifies `joinSig` (`verifyJoin` — binds `peerId` to this wave **and** that core key, so
  a relayed join stays sound and nobody can substitute a core key under someone else's
  `peerId`), records `peerId → writerKey`, opens that core by key, and **downloads only block
  0** (`download({start:0, end:1})`). Downloading just block 0 is what bounds spam to **one
  entry per peer** — extra blocks a malicious writer appends are never fetched. `wave-start` /
  `wave-sync` carry the same credentials in `writers`, so a late adopter is self-contained.
- **Paid gate, per peer.** When enforced, every peer checks `burnAuthorizes(burn, peerId,
waveId)` (§9.2) on a **direct** `wave-join` before ingesting it — a signature-only
  check, run identically by everyone. (The `writers` on
  `wave-start`/`wave-sync` omit the burn: they were pre-vetted by the initiator during the
  lobby, and the wave as a whole is gated by the start `paid` proof.) No on-chain call is on
  the ingest path — that would be O(N) REST reads per peer. The burn is verified where it has
  value: by **tippers/auditors** at their own pace via the entry's `burnTx`.
- **Posting is local and immediate.** A participant appends its one op at block 0 of **its
  own** core (`postEntry`) when its sweep slot fires — no admission, no writable-wait.
- **The view is a pure merge.** `mergeFeed(rawEntries)` folds the block-0 op of every held
  core into the ordered feed with one deterministic gate over the whole bag at once:
  - drop any op whose `joinSig` doesn't verify over `(waveId, peerId, writerKey)` by `peerId`
    (§2.2), or whose serialized `payload` exceeds `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` (oversized dropped);
  - keep the tip **`address` only if a signed burn backs it** (`burnAuthorizes` +
    `tronAddress === address`, else blanked);
  - verify-for-address then **drop the bulky `burn`**, keeping only `burnTx`;
  - **one entry per peer** + hop order (`buildFeed`).

  Same set of ops in → byte-identical feed out on every peer. That determinism (no
  consensus, no indexer) is what makes the feed a CRDT.

```mermaid

```

### 8.3 `wave-entry` op (core entry)

```json
{
  "type": "wave-entry",
  "waveId": "<hex16>",
  "peerId": "<peerId>",
  "hopCount": 3,
  "writerKey": "<coreKeyHex>",
  "joinSig": "<hex64>",
  "tag": "BR",
  "payload": {/* opaque application content — the host owns its shape */},
  "address": "T…",
  "burn": {/* the poster's §9.0 attestation — verified then dropped */},
  "burnTx": "<tron-tx-hash>" /* kept from the burn so the on-chain burn is locatable */,
  "timestamp": 1719705650000
}
```

The op lives at **block 0** of the poster's own core. `hopCount` is the poster's **sweep
rank** (its slot index in the schedule, §6.1) — the feed ordering key, so entries present
in ring order. `writerKey` + `joinSig` are the write-gate credential `mergeFeed()` verifies
(§8.2). `payload` is **opaque to the protocol** — arbitrary JSON the host owns, transported
and byte-capped but never interpreted (the reference app puts a `{image, caption}` selfie,
where `image` is an inline JPEG data-URL thumbnail; Hyperblobs is the scaling path). `tag`
is a cosmetic short string (the reference app uses an ISO country code). `address` is the poster's Tron (TRX) wallet, carried so a
viewer can **tip** this entry with a real testnet transfer (renderer `tip` → worker
`pay.send(address, amount)`; §WDK) — but only if `mergeFeed()` finds it backed by the
`burn` (§8.2), so a tip always reaches the wallet that paid in. Merged form: one entry per
`(waveId, peerId)`, the bulky `burn` stripped (its `txHash` kept as `burnTx` for audit),
sorted by `hopCount` then `timestamp`.

## 9. Participation fees — burning & verification

The money layer is **burned fees** (anti-spam / skin in the game) and **feed tips** (§8.3).
Each burn does real work: the **start** burn gates whether a wave is adoptable at all (the
paid-wave gate, §9.3), and a **join** burn gates whether peers will ingest that participant's
feed core (the ingest gate, §8.2). (Wire details: the paid-wave gate on
`wave-announce`/`wave-start`/`wave-sync` §5; the ingest gate rides `wave-join` §8.2.)

### 9.0 Fee-burn attestation

A fee burn is attested by a signed proof. The **start** attestation is carried as the
`paid` field on `wave-announce` / `wave-start` / `wave-sync`; a **join** attestation is
carried as the `burn` field on `wave-join` (§8.2). It is **not** an on-wire feed entry:

```json
{
  "waveId": "<hex16>",
  "peerId": "<peerId>",
  "reason": "start" | "join",
  "amount": 1,
  "txHash": "<tron-tx-hash>",
  "tronAddress": "T…",
  "burnTs": 1719705612080,
  "sig": "<hex128>"
}
```

Two independent bindings make it verifiable (the Tron key that signs the burn is a different
keypair from the ring identity, so both are needed):

1. **On-chain memo.** The burn tx carries `data = "hyperwave:<waveId>:<peerId>"` (readable via
   `gettransactionbyid`). The burn _itself names the wave_ — a third party can confirm it
   from-chain, and it can't be an old burn replayed for another wave (each carries its own
   random `waveId`, unguessable in advance).
2. **Ring attestation.** `sig` = Ed25519 by `peerId` over
   `(waveId, peerId, reason, amount, txHash, tronAddress, burnTs)` (§2.3) — binds the ring
   participant to the on-chain tx. `validKickoff` admits the proof only if `sig` verifies,
   and a peer then cross-checks the `txHash` on-chain before joining (§9.2).

### 9.1 The mechanism: fees are burned, not paid

Starting a wave (**start fee**) and opting into one (**join fee**) each cost a fixed
amount (1 TRX in the reference build), and the payment is **burned**: sent to Tron's
black-hole address

```
T9yD14Nj9j7xAB4dbGeiX9h8unkKHxuWwb        (base58check of the all-zero EVM address)
```

for which no private key exists — the funds are provably unspendable by _anyone_. This is
deliberate: the fee creates **skin in the game with no beneficiary** — nobody, not even the
wave's initiator, profits from a fee. (Tron rejects zero-amount transfers, so a burn is a real
small transfer; Tron also burns tx fees at the protocol level.) Spamming waves or Sybil-joining
costs real, irrecoverable value.

### 9.2 Binding a burn to its wave and its peer

A raw burn tx only proves "someone sent TRX to the black hole." The **on-chain memo** makes
it _"peer P burned specifically for wave W"_: every fee burn carries
`data = "hyperwave:<waveId>:<peerId>"`, readable via `gettransactionbyid`. Replay across waves
is impossible — each `waveId` is 16 random bytes, unguessable before the wave exists, and the
memo is part of the signed tx.

A second binding ties the burn to the ring identity, since the Tron key that signs the tx is a
**different keypair** from the peer's Ed25519 ring identity: the peer signs the attestation of
§9.0 with its ring key. Both fees carry it — the **start** one as the `paid` proof (so
peers can gate wave adoption), the **join** one as the `wave-join` `burn` field (so **every
peer** can gate whether it ingests that participant's feed core — §8.2).

### 9.3 Verification (who checks what, when)

- **Before joining (every peer):** a `wave-announce` must carry the initiator's start
  attestation (§9.0), validly signed — otherwise the announce is **ignored** (an unpaid wave
  is invisible). Before a peer joins (and pays its own fee), it verifies the start burn
  **on-chain** — `verifyBurnTx`: the tx exists, is a `TransferContract` **to the black
  hole**, from the attested address, `amount ≥ fee`, and the **memo commits this `waveId`**.
  `join()` is refused until this passes, so no peer ever pays into a wave the initiator
  hasn't paid for. The initiator, symmetrically, does not announce until its own burn is
  readable on-chain.
- **On each `wave-join` (every peer):** only the join's burn attestation **signature** is
  checked locally (`burnAuthorizes`, bound to peerId + wave) before ingesting that
  participant's feed core — ingest is **optimistic**, with deliberately **no on-chain call
  on the ingest path** (§8.2). The burn is verified on-chain where it has value: by
  tippers/auditors via the entry's `burnTx`.
- **Anyone, later:** because every fee's memo is on-chain, a third party can audit the fees
  of any wave with nothing but a Tron node — no trust in anyone's bookkeeping required.

Enforcement is active whenever an instance has a wallet; walletless test/headless runs skip
the gate (waves announce immediately, unpaid).

| `HEARTBEAT_MS`      | 2000   | heartbeat cadence (liveness + tag)                                             |
| `RINGUPDATE_MS`     | 4000   | seat-staleness + feed-pull maintenance cadence                                 |
| `PEER_STALE_MS`     | 12000  | a peer with no heartbeat within this window is stale (dropped)                 |
| `LOBBY_MS`          | 15000  | lobby / opt-in window                                                          |
| `SWEEP_LEAD_MS`     | 3000   | wave-start lead: `t0 = now + lead`, so the flooded start beats slot 0          |

| `MIN_LAP_MS`        | 4000   | lap floor (a tiny roster still sweeps visibly)                                 |
| `MAX_LAP_MS`        | 60000  | lap cap; also the receiver's `t0` horizon clamp (§6.6)                         |

| `MAX_PAYLOAD_BYTES` | 262144 | per-entry serialized payload cap (bounds writes under optimistic ingest, §8.2) |

These are timing/UX tunables, not wire-format; a compatible client should keep them in the
same ballpark for interop but exact values aren't required to match. The exceptions are the
receiver-side clamps (`MAX_LAP_MS` as lap cap + `t0` horizon), which are enforcement, not
tuning.

## 11. Security & trust notes

### 11.1 Foundations

- **Angle/seat** is bound to the public key and can't be forged without grinding keys.
- **Join attestations** authenticate each feed entry to a peer identity and to the writer
  core it posted from (§2.2); the **schedule** is derived by every peer from the same flooded
  `by`/`writers`, so all honest peers agree on who fires when without trusting each other.
- The **feed write-gate** is authenticity, not proof-of-participation (§8.2). A malicious
  fork can drop/ignore anything locally (open P2P); the protocol keeps _honest_ peers
  consistent. There are **no sponsor rewards**, so there is nothing to steal by faking
  participation — the only money flows are burned fees (nobody profits) and voluntary tips
  (paid directly, peer to peer). This removes the whole class of reward-gaming attacks.
- **Completion needs no trust.** The wave ends on every peer's own timer at
  `t0 + lapMs + END_GRACE_MS` — there is no end message to forge, lose, or suppress.
- Country is cosmetic and self-reported.

### 11.2 Adversarial hardening (against a modified client)

The transport (Noise over Hyperswarm) authenticates _who_ a message came from, but the
application logic must actually **use** that rather than trust self-reported fields. The
following guards keep a hostile peer running a modified app from disrupting honest peers:

- **Uniform envelope authenticity (§5.0).** Every message carries `origin`/`ts`/`sig`, and the
  receive edge verifies the envelope `sig` (by `origin`) on **every** message before acting or
  relaying — one shared check, so a forgery can't be relayed and authenticity never depends on the
  connection a flooded message arrived over.
- **Identity binding.** For a DIRECT (one-hop) message — `heartbeat`, `subs`, `wave-sync` — the
  envelope `origin` must equal the authenticated connection id it arrived on, else it's dropped.
  This blocks peer-map/ring pollution + spoofed subscriptions under a forged id. The flooded
  `wave-*` messages are deliberately **not** connection-bound: they are relayed, so their `origin`
  is a third party at relay hops — the envelope `sig` (plus the domain attestations: start proof,
  `joinSig`) authenticates them instead.
- **Message age bound / replay prevention (§5.0).** The receive edge drops (and never relays) any
  message whose signed `ts` is older than `GOSSIP_MAX_AGE_MS` — a hard cap on flood circulation
  (independent of `mid` dedup) AND replay prevention (a captured message can't have its `ts`
  refreshed without the key). The kick-off burn carries its own signed `burnTs` freshness window
  (`validStartProof`), so a stale burn reused in a fresh frame is also rejected.
- **Self-certifying feed cores.** A `wave-join`'s credential is signed over
  `(waveId, peerId, writerKey)` (§2.2), so a relay can't forge or substitute a core key under
  someone else's `peerId` and hijack that peer's feed seat — and there is **no shared
  feed key** to attack in the first place (each participant owns its own core, §8.1). The
  same signature is re-verified deterministically by `mergeFeed()` on every entry.
- **Hostile wave-start clamps.** A receiver caps `lapMs` at `MAX_LAP_MS` and ignores a start
  whose `t0` is more than `MAX_LAP_MS` in the future (§6.6), so a forged/buggy start can't
  wedge a wave open indefinitely — the deterministic end always arrives.
- **Canonical-roster schedule.** The sweep schedule is a pure function of the flooded
  `(origin + writers, t0, lapMs)`, so no peer can shift its own (or anyone's) slot without
  producing a different `wave-start` — which the paid-gate already constrains (a forged start needs
  a valid start burn-proof).
- **Paid-gate on every adoption path.** When enforced, `wave-announce`, `wave-start`, and
  `wave-sync` (both lobby **and** racing) are all gated on a valid start burn-proof, so no
  single message shape can push a peer into an unpaid/forged wave.
- **Optimistic per-peer ingest, bounded locally.** Ingesting a participant's core requires a
  valid join attestation and (when enforced) a _signed_ burn attestation, checked by **every
  peer** on each `wave-join`, but with **no on-chain check on the ingest path** (that would be
  O(N) reads per peer, §8.2). Spam is bounded deterministically instead — **block-0-only
  download → one entry per peer + a byte-size cap** — and the burn is verified where it has
  value: by tippers/auditors via `burnTx`. Trade-off: the hard "no unpaid write" gate becomes
  a **soft, publicly-detectable** one.
- **Burn-bound tip address + one entry per peer.** `mergeFeed()` deterministically keeps a
  entry's tip `address` only if a signed burn names that wallet, and folds one entry per peer
  (§8.2) — so tips can't be routed to a non-payer and a seat can't bloat the feed.
- **Cheap-before-expensive.** Adoption runs the cheap wave-filter (`canAdopt`) and flood
  dedup before any signature verification, limiting the CPU a gossip flood can extract.

### 11.3 Known residual risks (hardening backlog)

- **No per-connection rate limiting.** Gossip has flood-dedup, receiver clamps, and the
  cheap-before-verify ordering, but not yet a per-peer message budget; a peer can still spend a
  connection's bandwidth/CPU. With optimistic ingest this matters more (feed seats are
  cheap now — only signatures + one-per-peer + byte cap), so a per-connection token bucket is
  the natural cap on _how many_ joins/entries a single peer can push.
- **Optimistic ingest is a soft gate.** Since the burn isn't checked on the ingest path
  (§8.2), the feed can hold unpaid entries until they're caught (a tipper / an auditor via
  `burnTx`). They are detectable, but they _do_ consume (bounded) storage. Acceptable for the
  MVP scale; pair with the rate limit above at scale.
- **Clock skew shifts the choreography.** Slots and the deterministic end are wall-clock
  epoch times; a peer with a badly skewed clock fires early/late (a cosmetic wobble) and ends
  off-beat. `END_GRACE_MS` absorbs ordinary skew; there is no time-sync protocol.
- **Wallet-less mode is unauthenticated by design.** All paid-gate guarantees hold only when a
  wallet is present (`enforcePaid`); an unfunded demo/test run accepts unpaid waves and
  join-attestation-only feed ingest so the lifecycle can be exercised without on-chain
  calls. Don't mistake that mode for the security model.

## Appendix A — app-internal IPC (informative, not on-wire)

The reference build splits worker (protocol) from renderer (UI); they exchange these over
a local IPC bridge — the **`bare-rpc` host↔UI seam**, JSON-encoded (request/response for
`tip`/`send-trx`/`fetch-transactions`, one-way events otherwise; see `usage.md` §12). It kept
JSON (rather than a schema'd binary encoding) precisely because a single-build IPC has no version
skew for a schema to solve — the opposite trade-off from the gossip wire in §3, for the opposite
reason. A different client would have its own UI and need not match these — only §3–§8 are the
interop surface.

**Renderer → worker (commands):** `start-wave`, `join-wave`, `subscribe-wave {waveId}` /
`unsubscribe-wave {waveId}` (browse-then-pick: hold / free a wave's feed cores without
joining — relevant when the host runs `autoSubscribe:false`), `set-tag {tag}`,
`stage-entry {entry:{payload}}` (stage the opaque entry payload; the worker pairs it with
the peer's sweep slot and posts it when the slot fires — the football app puts a
`{image, caption}` selfie in the payload), `tip {to, amount}` (send a real TRX tip to an
entry owner's wallet), `send-trx {to, amount}`, `fetch-transactions`, `refresh-wallet`
(manual balance re-check after funding).

**Worker → renderer (events):** `state {me,peers,connected,discovered}`; `feed {waveId, items}`;
`wallet {address, trx}` (self-custodial TRX wallet); `tip-result {hash?, error?}`;
`burn-result {stage: 'confirming'|'burned'|'failed', hash?, amount?, error?, waveId?, reason}`
(a **participation fee** — 1 TRX burned
to Tron's black hole address `T9yD14Nj9j7xAB4dbGeiX9h8unkKHxuWwb`, i.e. the all-zero EVM
address: unspendable by anyone, so the fee proves skin in the game without enriching any
party. `reason: 'start'` for the initiator on `start-wave`, `'join'` for each opt-in on
`join-wave`. Fired alongside the action, never blocking the wave); and
`event` events: `wave-announce`, `paying` (initiator burning the start fee before
announcing), `wave-verified` (start burn proven — join is now allowed), `wave-unpaid`
(start failed verification — wave abandoned), `join-blocked {reason}` (tried to join
before the start is verified), `joined`, `roster`, `wave-active`, `wave-idle`, `busy`,
`started`, `holding {angle,hopCount,...}` (my sweep slot fired — my staged entry
posts now), `position {holder,angle,hopCount}` (locally generated from the schedule as each
slot passes — this is what animates the ⚽; there is no position gossip), `completed
{waveId,hops,angle}` (fires on **every** peer at the deterministic end).
